# IC2S2-Active-Inference-Tutorial
Landing page and repository for the 'Active Agents' tutorial held 17 July, 2024 at the 10th International Conference on Computational Social Science.

1. Open the Google Colab link below to open a read-only version of the tutorial code. With a valid GMail account, click `File` $\rightarrow$ `Save a copy in Drive` to save an editable copy.
2. Click `Runtime` $\rightarrow$ `Run all` to run the code. The simulations near the end will take a bit of time to play out (two simulations, 30 generative models each, roughly 4-5 minutes total), so better to have these ready to go so that you can follow along smoothly!
